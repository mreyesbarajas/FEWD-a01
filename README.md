## Introduction
### Hello! María here ^^

Where to start~ As stated up in the title above, my name is María Reyes. Despite being in my mid 20s now (where did the time go?) I am no closer to figuring out what and where I am headed with anything, but I'm not *too* worried yet! The adventure is half the fun or so I keep telling myself. Professionally about me; I graduated from CSU Long Beach with a B.A. in Fine Arts where I focused on Animation and Illustration for the most part which I absolutely loved. In the midst of the pandemic when I found myself with time to spare and little hope for my future prospects, I ventured in the Media Design program here at SDCE where I learned how to Graphic Design (new medium acquired!) and upon finishing that program, continued onto FEWD. In the summer prep course for FEWD I learned about the so called "unicorn" or double threat of knowing how to code *and* design; I saw that, a light bulb went off in my mind and went "that's so me, that's what I aim to be", and proceeded to run with it. 


It's been an uphill battle but I've learned loads in these past two years from taking on these ventures and hope to only learn and achieve more. Progress is progress at the end of the day. When I'm not working or fiddling with drawing or coding specifically I can be found at dance practice (ballet folklorico) or crochetting (newest hobby). Bet you're wondering just how many hobbies can one person have? and that there's no way one can indulge in everything on a healthy schedule and you'd be right! Oh how I wish the days were longer or freer sometimes because there's days where I just want to crochet all day and others where I just want to lay on the grass and do nothing but it is what it is.

Here's a list of all my current hobbies, in order of current hyperfixation;
* crochet
* blender (3D program)
* ballet folklorico (on hold till I find a new studio ;-;)
* emboridery
* baking

Here's a picture of me (on the far left!) of my members / friends from Grupo Folklorico Mexica de CSULB dancing a Jalisco suite!
